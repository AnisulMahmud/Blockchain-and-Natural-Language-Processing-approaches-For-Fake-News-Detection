# Toward News Authenticity: Synthesizing Natural Language Processing [ Continuous Learning ] and Human Expert Opinion [Blockchain] to Evaluate News



## Blockchain part ( Without NLP folder ) 

### Features
-  Frontend built on React.js
-  Styling with TailwindCSS
-  Blockchain development, testing and deployment using Truffle & Ganache
-  Cryptocurrency Wallet [MetaMask])


### Clone : First of all clone this repository 
gh repo clone AnisulMahmud/Blockchain-and-Natural-Language-Processing-approaches-For-Fake-News-Detection

### Then install in the local directory 
npm i -g truffle

### Then run this commands

- truffle compile

- truffle migrate

- ganache-ali.cmd in the local directory to open [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) and import two or more test accounts into [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

### Then run this commands
- cd Blockchain-and-Natural-Language-Processing-approaches-For-Fake-News-Detection/app
- npm install
- npm start

Then open `http://localhost:3000/` to see the app.

## NLP part: 
### After that we use continuous learning based NLP.
There is a folder called NLP here, though all the files are not uploaded here. So after completing the NLP part, we connect NLP part and Blockcahin part to get a synthesized result. 

## IEEE PAPER: 

### We published a paper on IEEE XPlore. It has an open Access. See the paper for more info about the project and its working methods and flow.
